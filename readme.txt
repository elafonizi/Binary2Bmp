Introduction

Binary2Bmp
This tool takes any file as input, and creates a bmp based on the input's binary data. Choose width, or go with the default calculated. For instance test this on an executable, and redo the operation by using Image2PixelBytes.

Image2PixelBytes
This tool converts the pixels of an image into a pure binary file containing the raw pixelbytes. For a test, recreate an image off the output by using Binary2Bmp on it with the correct width.
